# Fish Freshness 

A method to determine the freshness of a fish , from analysing the photo of its gill . 

The project is based into 2 parts : Segmentation and Classification . The Segmentation is based on isolating colourspaces and the Classification is based on statistical methods applied on fish gills . 

> The accompanying code in 'main.py' is a demonstration of our method. It is a high level representation of the pipeline I proposed in the paper. For better accuracy, I recommend you to find appropriate parameters after using the method on some validated samples based on your specific test case.
